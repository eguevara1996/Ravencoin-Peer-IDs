# Ravencoin-Peer-IDs
This repo contains a list of Ravencoin-related peer IDs for IPFS nodes (CSV format).

This list can be used to bootstrap, swarm connect or peer with Ravencoin-related IPFS nodes.

For information about how to set up your IPFS config for persistent peer connections, modify your IPFS config file according to the documentation here:
https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/v0.6.0/docs/config.md#peeringpeers
